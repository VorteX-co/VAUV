# Vision

## Description
The Vision package is responsible for image enhancement, image processing, and performing multiple deep learning models and computer vision algorithms on the video streams coming from the AUV cameras' to detect its targets to publish the AUV current state to the other modules.

## Nodes

### image_enhancement
The image enhancement node is responsible for improving the quality of the raw images before processing. By  applying many filters for histogram equalization, Noise removal, and so on.
#### Subscribed Topics
* **`/~/left_raw/image_rect_color `** ([sensor_msgs/Frame])
  raw frames from ZED camera.
* **`/lowlight_camera`** ([sensor_msgs/Frame])
  raw frames from low light camera.  
#### Published Topics
* **`/enhanced frame_l`** ([sensor_msgs/Frame])
* **`/enhanced frame_z`** ([sensor_msgs/Frame])
  The enhanced frames after manipulating contrast and correcting the image color 
  
### object_detection 
Contains deep learning models that take the enhanced frame to get the image details.
#### Subscribed Topics
* **`/enhanced frame`** ([sensor_msgs/Frame])
  The enhanced frame that published by image_enhancement node.
#### Published Topics
* **`/image details`** ([str_msgs/Data])
  The image details data contains the target classes and their coordinates.
  

### target_analysis
Contains computer vision algorithms that take the enhanced frames and image details data to get finer details about the detected target.

#### Subscribed Topics
* **`/enhanced frame`** ([sensor_msgs/Frame])
* **`/image details`** ([str_msgs/Data])
#### Published Topics
* **`/object details`** ([str_msgs/Data])
  The object details data contains finer details inside the object itself.
  
### data_fusion
Takes the data from object_detection and target_analysis nodes and handle it to get more informative messages about the AUV current state.

#### Subscribed Topics
* **`/object details`** ([str_msgs/Data])
* **`/image details`** ([str_msgs/Data])
#### Published Topics
* **`/current state`** ([str_msgs/Data])
  The current state data contains informative messages about the AUV current state.

## Hardware
This package acess the following hardware:
* ZED 2 Camera
* Low Light Camera
