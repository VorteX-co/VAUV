# Mission Planning Package

## Description

It starts with the **planning layer** which contains **task manager**, it sends next mission to be executed to the execution layer based on the labeled camera feed and mission priority.
In the **execution layer** :
* The **task controller** takes input (from task manager) the next mission to be executed and the task feedback ( from task failure handler which takes its readings from sensor fusion), then splits the mission to primitive tasks in correct order to stack them in the scheduler.

* The **scheduler**  sends tasks id to **global planner** to start execution and also **task scheduler** sends task id to **task failure handler** for monitoring the mission execution.

* The **feedback handler**  takes input (from scheduler) the current executing mission ID to help knowing what feedback threshold to expect and which sensors to get its readings from, then sends feedback on each task to task controller and the **task controller** provide a general feedback from several tasks connected to the same mission and send this general feedback to task manager to be able to log the status in log file ,here we have two cases 
    * In case of success therefore there is nothing to be done!	 
    * In case of failure, the task manager decides to redo the mission with a number of attempts and it may also delete the mission and its dependent mission from the scheduler.

### task_controller node

Maps each mission id to a corresponding finite state machine, Loops on each current state in the FSM until this state changes based on the feedback from the task failure handler until the FSM is finished and another one takes its place.
